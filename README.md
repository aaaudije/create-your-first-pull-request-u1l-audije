Exercise 01: Git | Title: Create your first Pull Request

This exercise requires the student to create their own repository. They will work in pairs to collaborate for them to add comments to each other's work by adding a new branch
in the repository and have them use 'pull-request'. The creator of the repository will then merge it to the main branch.

My repository:
1. I created a repository which includes my expectations in CMSC 100 in the main branch.
2. I added my partner as a collaborator in the repository for her to add her comments.
3. After she has sent her pull-request, I merged her comments from her branch to my main branch.

My task as a partner:
1. I cloned my partner's repository to my Git.
2. I created my own branch ("audije") abd used the 'add, commit, push' in adding my comments to her repository.
3. I created a pull-request for her to approve.
