I’m expecting that the lab exercises would be bearable as I got a glimpse of how it will be implemented
(I assume that all or majority of the exercises will be  take-home, having a week deadline.) However, there’s a project in this course
so I think that would be difficult as it might require us to use all the lessons.

Edit (Anareta):
- I agree that lab exercises would be bearable given that the given lab handouts would be sufficient in finishing the exercises on time
- Also hoping for most of teh lab exercises to be take-home
- I agree that the project might be difficult but also hoping for it to be manageable.
